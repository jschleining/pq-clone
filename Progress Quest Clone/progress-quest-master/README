Progress Quest - Web
====================

This is the in-browser edition of Progress Quest, ported from Delphi
to JavaScript.

- Progress Quest site:  http://progressquest.com/
- Play it here:         http://progressquest.com/play/
- Original version:     https://bitbucket.org/grumdrig/pq

The whole thing runs in the browser, on the client side, using HTML5
storage and so forth; there's no server side other that hosting static
files. To run your own copy, clone this repo, and open index.html.
